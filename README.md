# Code Review Scenario

You (your team) are a new employee of SoftwarePile Inc. You have been asked to review code from various SofwarePile projects as part of your on-boarding process (i.e., getting you ready for meaningful code / work contribution). The initial review packets contain both individual source files and packages containing multiple source files that make up features in both SoftwarePile's internal and customer focused development efforts. 

Your task is to review the code provided and record issues that you find. For each individual file, provide a brief description of what the code accomplishes. For each package, provide a high-level overview of the functionality provided. 

When recording defects, use the following rankings to determine severity: 
1 - Must fix now
2 - Fix as part of planned debugging sessions
3 - Fix only if editing code for a different purpose
